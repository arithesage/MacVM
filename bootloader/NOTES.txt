General notes:
-------------------
- To mount a qcow2 image do:
    > sudo modprobe nbd
    > sudo qemu-nbd --connect /dev/nbd0 <qcow2 file path>
    > sudo mount /dev/nbd0pX <mount point>

  If the disk has more than one partition, each one will be found in
  /dev/nbd0pX, being X 0-N.

  You can add "-o uid=$(id -u),gid=$(id -g)" without quotes to the command
  line for working with the mounted image as your user instead of needing
  use sudo.

  For unmount the image do:
    > sudo unmount <mount point>
    > sudo qemu-nbd --disconnect /dev/nbd0
    > sudo rmmod nbd

  The last line is only needed if you have finished mounting qcow2 files.


- To mount a img, if you have udiskctl command, do:
    > udiskctl loop-setup --file <img file path>
    > udiskctl mount --block-device /dev/loopX
 
  Being X 0-N. Start with 0 if you can.
  For unmount the image, do the same but with unmount.




OpenCore notes while testing with OS X Leopard
------------------------------------------------
- If no disk is shown in the bootloader, even while Leopard ISO is loaded,
  try setting Misc > Security > ScanPolicy to 0 in config.plist.

- If boot crashes with "Could not allocate driver module memory" error,
  try enabling AllowRelocationBlock.

- If you get a AppleIntelCPUPowerManagement Kernel Panic, try enabling
  Kernel > Emulate > DummyPowerManagement.
